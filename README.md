I created this web app to help learn JS. At the beginning of writing this I was pretty much completely at loss for what to do. Step by step as I built this code quiz (Which is still a work in progress) I felt like I am starting to understand little by little more JS. The structure and organization of my code is non existant. As I progressed in learning while building this project I began to realize how a ton of my earliest mistakes were and still are affecting my code later. I need to completely reorganize this code before I can complete the project the way I want it to be done.
